# SPARK Deequ explorations

This repository contains a number of small demo programs to explore different aspects of utilizing Deequ for calculating metrics and verifications. 

All programs has been run locally in VS Code, with the scala-lang.scala, scalameta.metals, and the vscjava.vscode-java-pack extensions installed. 

The sample data is from https://github.com/Teradata/kylo/tree/master/samples/sample-data. I added an 'avro-nested' sample under this.
